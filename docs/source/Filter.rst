Filter
======

Filters candidate variants called by ProDuSe based upon the following characteristics:

    - Minimum molecule counts: The number of molecules supporting a variant at a given position must deviate from the number expected from simple noise in order to call a variant.
    - Molecule type: Stronger (duplex, strong bases) molecules will be examined for support (or lack of support) for a variant first. If too many strong molecule do not support a variant when support is expected, the variant will be discarded.
    - (If designated) Dual strand support: Both the positive and negative strand must support a variant confidently before it is called.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

    :-c --config:
        A configuration file which can supply any of the parameters described below.
    :-i --input:
        Input VCF file, listing candidate variants and molecule counts.
    :-m --molecule_stats:
        A tab-delineated file listing total depth and different molecule abundances across the entire capture space. Generated by snv.py.
    :-o --output:
        Path and name to use for the output VCF file.
    :-sb --strand_bias_threshold:
        Strand bias p-value threshold. If the strand bias of a variant is below this value, the variant will be discarded.
    :-st --strong_base_threshold:
        Minimum number of strong bases required to call a variant. Note that this threshold will increase depending on locus and overall library characteristics for each molecule type.
    :-wt --weak_base_threshold:
        Minimum number of weak bases required to call a variant. Note that this threshold will increase depending on locus and capture space characteristics for each molecule type.

Additional Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the duplicate rate of a library is extremely low, variants will be called based upon weak bases. Thus, a large number of false positive calls may be generated.
